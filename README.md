# Week 1 JavaScript Code Challenges – Moringa School

## Overview

This is my submission for the Week 1 code challenge at Moringa. It includes three small JavaScript projects to practice things like:

- variables and data types
- if/else statements
- functions
- getting user input using `prompt-sync`
- doing basic math

## How to Set Up

Before running the code, you need to install `prompt-sync` so that the scripts can get input from the user in the terminal.

Open the terminal and run:

npm install prompt-sync

Make sure you are in the main project folder when you do this.


## Challenges

1. **Chai Bora Calculator** – Calculates ingredients needed based on how many cups of tea you want to make.
2. **Boda Boda Fare Estimator** – Tells you how much your boda ride might cost depending on distance.
3. **Mobile Money Fee Estimator** – Calculates how much fee is charged when sending money.

## Folder Structure

## Folder Structure

I organized each challenge into its own folder like this:

- `chaiCalculator/` – has the chai calculator script (`chai.js`)
- `bodaFareCalculator/` – has the boda fare estimator (`fare.js`)
- `mobileMoneyEstimator/` – has the mobile money fee calculator (`fee.js`)


Each file has a solution to the specific challenge.
