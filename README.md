# Week 1 JavaScript Code Challenges – Moringa School

## Overview

This is my submission for the Week 1 code challenge at Moringa School. It includes three simple JavaScript projects designed to practice key programming concepts such as:

- Variables and data types
- If/else statements
- Functions and return values
- Getting user input using prompt-sync
- Basic arithmetic operations

## How to Set Up and Run

To get started with this project:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal and run the following command, replacing [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL] with the actual URL of your GitHub repository:

    
bash
    git clone [YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL]


2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    
bash
    cd code-challenge--1


3.  **Install prompt-sync:**
    Each script uses prompt-sync to read user input in the terminal. You must install it first:

    
bash
    npm install prompt-sync


4.  **Run the scripts:**
    Navigate into the specific challenge folder and run the script using Node.js:

    
bash
    cd chaiCalculator # Example for the first challenge
    node chai.js

    # To run other challenges, navigate to their folders:
    # cd ../bodaFareCalculator
    # node fare.js

    # cd ../mobileMoneyEstimator
    # node fee.js

## Challenges

1.  **Chai Bora Ingredient Calculator**
    Calculates the ingredients needed based on how many cups of tea you want to prepare.

2.  **Boda Boda Fare Estimator**
    Estimates the fare for a boda ride based on distance and a base rate.

3.  **Mobile Money Fee Estimator**
    Calculates the transaction fee when sending money, including limits for minimum and maximum fees.

## Folder Structure

bash
code-challenge--1/

Each folder contains the script for one challenge.

chaiCalculator/ – this has the file chai.js for calculating tea ingredients

bodaFareCalculator/ – this has fare.js, which estimates the boda ride fare

mobileMoneyEstimator/ – this contains fee.js, which works out the mobile money fees
